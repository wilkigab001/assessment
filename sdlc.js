// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements  = 'This is the second step, in which you determine what your program will need concerning coding languages, applications, templates and other materials you will use'
const design = 'Step 3 requires you to design and decide how your code will look, writing psuedocode for what you have'
const implementation = 'Step 4 is where you implement what you have gone over and apply/implement what you have gone over in the previous three steps and write the code'
const testingAndIntegration = 'Step 5 is crucial as it is where you test and look for the bugs in the software to make sure your code functions properly'
const maintain = 'When client feedback changes, or are in need of a new function/toolset for the code, or a bug is discovered the maintanance team updates the software to make sure it is relevant and functional towards the market need.'
